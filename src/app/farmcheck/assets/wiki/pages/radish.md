#### How to plant

1. ###### Add organic matter before sowing but also avoid fresh manure or fertilizers high in nitrogen; overly rich soil will encourage lush foliage at the expense of radish roots.
2. ###### Radish seeds have a fairly long shelf life. Don’t be afraid to plant radish seeds that are up to 5 years old. All may not germinate, but you’ll have plenty that will.
3. ###### Direct-sow seeds outdoors about 1 cm deep and cover loosely with soil. Space 2 cm apart in rows 30 cm apart. Water seeds thoroughly, down to 15 cm deep.
4. ###### Sow another round of seeds every 10 days or so while weather is still cool for a continuous harvest of radishes in the late spring and early summer.
