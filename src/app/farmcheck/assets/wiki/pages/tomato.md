#### How to plant

1. ###### Transplant your seedlings (or your nursery-grown plants) into the ground outdoors after all danger of frost has passed and the soil is at least 15°C
2. ###### Place tomato stakes or cages in the soil at planting. Staking and caging keep developing fruit off the ground (to avoid disease and pests) and also help the plant to stay upright
3. ###### Remember to allow enough space for the plants to spread out.
4. ###### Water well to reduce shock to the roots.
