#### How to plant

1. ###### Peas are best direct-seeded right in the ground and do not like their roots disturbed. But transplanting is possible, if you start seeds in biodegradable pots; you’ll transplant the pot and all into the garden and the pot will disintegrate.
2. ###### Sow seeds 2 cm deep (slightly deeper if soil is dry) and about 5 cm apart. Do not thin. Plant rows 15 cm apart.
3. ###### Bush peas can reach 45 to 75 cm tall.  Pole types can grow at least 120 to 180 cm tall. Both types benefit from support (especially bush peas above 60 cm and all pole peas). Install thin tree branches or twiggy sticks (pea sticks), trellises, chicken wire, strings, or netting before plants establish their shallow roots
4. ###### Water to keep the soil moist. If seeds wash out of the soil, poke them back into it.
