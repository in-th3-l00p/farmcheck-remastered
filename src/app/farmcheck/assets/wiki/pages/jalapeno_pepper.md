#### How to plant

1. ###### If you’re sowing seeds into trays or containers to plant in the ground later, fill with seed-starting mix that is best for growing chili peppers. (Potting mixes are fine but hold onto moisture a little too well which peppers can’t stand). We recommend mixing a half ordinary all-purpose peat-free potting mix combined with half coir or coco fiber, with a good few handfuls of vermiculite thrown in for good measure.
2. ###### Plant seeds just 1/2 cm deep (you can just cover lightly with seed-starting mix). Water in and keep peppers moist (though never wet). Ensure your seedlings have good airflow and aren’t crowded.
3. ###### About 10 days before transplanting your jalapeño seedlings (or starter plants that you bought) outdoors, begin to harden off to better transition to the outdoors. In cold regions, you can use black plastic mulch to warm the soil prior to planting.
4. ###### Once soil and nighttime temperatures reach at least 60°F (15°C), transplant your seedlings (or purchased starts) outdoors, spacing them 35 to 60 cm apart.
5. ###### For transplants, dig a planting hole just deep enough to cover the root-ball of the plant and, when you set the plant in the hole, ensure the top of the root-ball is level with the ground surface. Do not plant deeply like tomatoes!
