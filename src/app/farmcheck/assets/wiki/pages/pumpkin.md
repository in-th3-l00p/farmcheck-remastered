#### How to plant

1. ###### Plant in rows 180 to 300 cm apart. Or, plant in hills 120 to 240 cm apart. A hill does not mean the soil has to be mounded; it’s a spot containing a group of plants or seeds. Hills warm soil quickly (so seeds germinate faster) and aid with drainage and pest control. Prepare hills by digging down 30 to 40 cm and mixing/filling in with lots of aged manure and/or compost.
2. ###### In rows, sow seeds 15 to 30 cm apart. Once seedlings are 5 to 7 cm tall, thin to one plant every 45 to 90 cm.
3. ###### In hills, set seeds 2 cm deep with four or five seeds per hill. Keep seeds moist until germination. When seedings are 5 to 7 cm tall, thin to two or three per hill by snipping out unwanted plants.
4. ###### If sowing indoors in peat pots, harden off seedlings before transplanting into warm, aged manure/compost-enriched soil.
