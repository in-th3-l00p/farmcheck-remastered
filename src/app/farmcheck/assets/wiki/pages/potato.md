#### How to plant

1. ###### One to 2 days ahead of planting, use a clean, sharp paring knife to cut large potatoes into golf ball-size pieces, with 1 to 2 eyes each
2. ###### Potatoes grow best in rows about 90 cm apart. With a hoe or round-point shovel, dig a trench row about 15 cm wide and 20 cm deep. Taper the bottom to about 7 cm wide. Spread and mix in aged manure, compost, and/or leaves.
3. ###### In each trench, place a seed potato piece cut side down every 30 to 35 cm and cover with 7 to 10 cm of soil.
4. ###### In 12 to 16 days after planting, when sprouts appear, use a hoe to gently fill in the trench with another 7 to 10 cm of soil, leaving a few cm of the plants exposed. Repeat as they grow (in several weeks), until the trench is at ground level.
