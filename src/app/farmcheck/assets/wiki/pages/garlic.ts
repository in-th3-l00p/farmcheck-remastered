#### How to plant

1. ###### Immediately before planting, work a couple tablespoons of 5-10-10 complete fertilizer, bonemeal, or fish meal into the soil several cm below where the base of the garlic cloves will rest.
2. ###### Break apart cloves from the bulb a few days before planting, but keep the papery husk on each individual clove.
3. ###### Plant cloves 10 to 20 cm apart and 5 cm deep, in their upright position (with the wider root side facing down and pointed end facing up).
4. ###### Plant in rows spaced 15 to 30 cm apart. A single 300 cm row should yield about 5 pounds of the fragrant bulbs, depending on the variety.
