#### How to plant

1. ###### Before planting, mix in a nice low organic fertilizer (such as a 5-5-5) about 30 cm into the soil. Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, or you’ll get leafy greens at the expense of a big root. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizer.
2. ###### Sow seeds directly in the soil 1/2 to 1 cm deep, 2 cm apart, in rows 30 to 45 cm apart.
3. ###### You can also scatter turnip seed and thin later. Cover seeds with not more than 1 cm of soil.
4. ###### Water well and consistently. Protect spring crops from pests with row covers at planting.
