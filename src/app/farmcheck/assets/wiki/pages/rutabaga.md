#### How to plant

1. ###### Maximize your harvest with a balanced (10-10-10) fertilizer, adding half of the recommended amount at planting and half about 4 weeks after planting. Avoid too much nitrogen at all once, which can impeded bulb formation.
2. ###### Plant seeds 1 cm deep, 5 cm apart, in rows 35 to 45 cm apart.
3. ###### To sidestep a hot summer, start seedlings indoors and set them out when it’s cloudy. Or direct-seed into the ground and thin later to proper spacing.
4. ###### Seeds will germinate in 4 to 7 days. After germination, thin to 15 cm apart. Do NOT crowd rutabagas, or they will grow huge tops with skinny roots.
