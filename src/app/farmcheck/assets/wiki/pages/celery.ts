#### How to plant

1. ###### Before sowing, soak seeds in warm water overnight. This will speed germination. The seeds are tiny, so handle with care and a keen eye!
2. ###### Fill seed flats or pots with good-quality seed starting mix then gently firm it level.
3. ###### Press soaked seeds into seed-starting soil; to get good germination, do not cover with soil. The easiest way to sow the seeds is to carefully tap the packet above the surface of the potting mix and watch carefully as the seeds fall. Ideally you want them to fall about 2 cm apart. Once you’re done, firm the seeds into place.
4. ###### Maintain an ambient temperature of 70° to 75°F (21° to 24°C) during the day and 60° to 65°F (15° to 18°C) at night.
5. ###### When seedlings are 5 cm tall, transplant them to individual peat pots or to deeper flats with new potting soil. In flats, set the plants at least 5 cm apart.
