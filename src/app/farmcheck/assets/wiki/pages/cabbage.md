#### How to plant

1. ###### Sow seeds 1/2 cm deep.
2. ###### Before planting the seedlings outdoors, harden off the plants over the course of a week.
3. ###### Transplant seedlings outdoors on a cloudy afternoon 2 to 3 weeks before the last spring frost date.
4. ###### Plant seedlings 30 to 60 cm apart in rows, depending on the size of head desired. (Closer spacing yields smaller heads.)
