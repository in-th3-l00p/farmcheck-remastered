#### How to plant

1. ###### Plant okra seeds about 1 to 2 cm deep and 30 to 45 cm apart in a row. You can soak the seeds overnight in tepid water to help speed up germination. 
2. ###### If you are planting okra transplants, be sure to space them 30 to 60 cm apart to give them ample room to grow.
3. ###### Okra plants are tall, so space out the rows 90 to 120 cm apart.
