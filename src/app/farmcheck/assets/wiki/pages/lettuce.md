#### How to plant

1. ###### Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 of a cm deep. Lettuce seeds need light to germinate, so don’t sow them too deep.
2. ###### Seed may be sown in single rows or broadcast for wide row planting (loose-leaf varieties are best for this). When broadcasting, thin 2 to 5 cm tall seedlings for the proper spacing.
3. ###### Set rows of lettuce 30 to 40 cm apart. Sow additional seeds every 2 weeks for a continuous harvest.
4. ###### Water thoroughly with a mist nozzle at time of transplanting or seeding.
