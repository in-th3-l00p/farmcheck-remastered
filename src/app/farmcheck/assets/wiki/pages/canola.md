#### How to plant

1. ###### Canola is a tiny seed, which means that sowing depth must be well controlled
2. ###### Alternate wetting and drying of the seed at the soil surface can cause patchy germination
3. ###### The seed is best sown shallow, but still covered by a thin layer of soil to protect it from drying out before or after germination
