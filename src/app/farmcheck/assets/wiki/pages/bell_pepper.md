#### How to plant

1. ###### If you’re buying pepper starts, choose ones with straight, sturdy stems, 4 to 6 leaves, and no blooms or fruit. To harden off pepper plants, set plants outdoors a week or more after the frost free date or when the average daily temperatures reaches 18°C.
2. ###### Before transplanting in the garden, mix aged manure and/or compost into the soil about 20 to 25 cm deep and rake it several times to break up the large clods.
3. ###### Put transplants into the ground once the soil temperature has reached 65°F (18°C). Speed up the warming of the soil by covering it with black plastic or a dark mulch about a week before you intend to plant.
4. ###### Make the transplant holes 7 to 10 cm deep and 30 to 45 cm apart in the row. Space the rows 60 to 90 cm apart. Before planting, fill the holes with water and let it soak in. Into each planting hole, put two or three wooden matchsticks (for sulfur) and 1 teaspoon of low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer (too much nitrogen will reduce fruit set).
5. ###### When pulling the transplant out of its tray or pot, be gentle and leave as much soil as possible around the roots. Set the transplants about 2 cm deeper than they were in their original container. Fill the hole with soil and pack it loosely around the plant. Leave a slightly sunken area around each plant to hold water.
