#### How to plant

1. ###### For pole beans, set up trellises, stakes, or other supports prior to planting so that the plants’ fragile roots are not disturbed.
2. ###### One option is to create a tepee: Tie three or four (or more) 200 cm long bamboo poles or long, straight branches together at the top and splay the legs in a circle. Then plant three or four seeds around each pole. As vines appear, train them to wind up the poles. For more stability, wrap string/wire around the poles about halfway up, encircling the tepee; this gives the vines something to grab.
3. ###### Another easy support for them is a “cattle panel”—a portable section of wire fence 480 cm long and 150 cm tall. The beans will climb with ease and you won’t have to get into contorted positions to pick them.
4. ###### For a continued harvest that lasts all summer, sow seeds every 2 weeks. If you’re going to be away and unable to harvest, skip a planting. Beans do not wait for anyone!
