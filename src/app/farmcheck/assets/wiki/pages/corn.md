#### How to plant

1. ###### Sow seeds about 3 to 5 cm deep and 5 to 10 cm apart in short, side-by-side rows to form a block, rather than one long row.
2. ###### For decent pollination, we recommend a modest block of, say, 10 to 50 plants.
3. ###### You may choose to fertilize at planting time with a 10-10-10 fertilizer; corn is meant to grow rapidly. If you are confident that the soil is adequate, this step can be skipped.
4. ###### Water well at planting time.
