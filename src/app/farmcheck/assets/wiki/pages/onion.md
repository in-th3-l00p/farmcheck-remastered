#### How to plant

1. ###### Bury onion sets 5 to 15 cm apart, gently pressing them into loose soil no more than 2 cm deep. (Use the closer spacing if you want to pull immature onions as scallions.)
2. ###### Space transplants 10 to 12 cm apart and rows 30 to 45 cm apart.
3. ###### Set the bulbs with the point end up. Again, don’t bury them more than 2 cm under the soil. It’s important that onions aren’t planted too deep, as this can affect bulb development.
4. ###### Mulch with straw between rows to help retain moisture and stifle weeds.
