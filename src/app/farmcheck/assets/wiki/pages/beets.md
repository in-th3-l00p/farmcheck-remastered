#### How to plant

1. ###### We prefer to sow beets directly in the garden so that we don’t have to disturb their roots. However, beets—unlike many root crops—do generally tolerate being transplanted while still young. Since they are cold tolerant, beets typically have no trouble being started outdoors, though.
2. ###### Sow seeds 1 cm deep and 2 to 5 cm apart in rows that are about 30 to 45 cm apart. After sowing, cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil.
3. ###### Make sure soil remains moist for optimal germination. Soak seeds for 24 hours prior to planting to speed up germination.
