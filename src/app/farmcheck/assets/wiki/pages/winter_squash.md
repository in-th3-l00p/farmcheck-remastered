#### How to plant

1. ###### Direct-sow (i.e., plant seeds directly in the ground) when all danger of frost has passed and the soil is at least -6°C, preferably -3°C.  Squash are very sensitive to the cold.
2. ###### If you plan to grow only a few plants, use 2 to 3 tablespoons of a balanced (10-10-10) fertilizer for each hill. Scatter the fertilizer evenly over a 60 by 60 cm area. Work it into the top 7 to 10 cm of soil.
3. ###### Sow seeds in level ground 2 cm deep with seeds 60 to 90 cm apart. Or, sow 3 to 4 seeds close together in small mounds (or hills; the soil is warmer off the ground) in rows 90 to 180 cm apart.
4. ###### Use row covers to prevent insect problems early in the season Remember to remove covers before flowering to allow pollination by insects.
