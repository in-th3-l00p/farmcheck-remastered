#### How to plant

1. ###### Sow seeds 2 cm deep and about 90 to 150 cm apart in a row, depending on variety (see seed packet for details). For vines trained on a trellis, space seeds or plants 30 cm apart.
2. ###### After planting, mulch around the area with straw, chopped leaves, or another organic mulch to keep pests at bay, and also keep bush types off the ground to avoid disease.
3. ###### A trellis is a good idea if you want the vine to climb, or if you have limited space. Trellising also protects the fruit from damage from lying on the moist ground.
4. ###### Cover freshly planted cucumber seeds with row covers, netting, or a berry basket if you have pests; this will keep them from digging out the seeds.
