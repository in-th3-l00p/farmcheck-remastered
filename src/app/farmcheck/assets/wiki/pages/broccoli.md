#### How to plant

1. ###### If starting seeds outdoors, sow seeds 1 cm deep and 7 cm apart. Once seedlings reach a height of 5 to 7 cm, thin them so that plants are 30 to 50 cm apart.
2. ###### If you started seeds indoors, plant transplants that are 4 to 6 weeks old (and have 4 or 5 leaves) outdoors, 30 to 50 cm apart, in holes slightly deeper than their container depth.
3. ###### Space rows of broccoli 90 cm apart. (Closer spacing yields smaller main heads, but more secondary heads.). Water well at the time of planting.
