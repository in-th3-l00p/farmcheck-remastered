#### How to plant

1. ###### Sow seeds in rows 7 to 15 cm apart and up to 1 cm deep. Set plants 45 to 60 cm apart with 75 cm between rows.
2. ###### In early spring, be ready to protect plants from frost by covering them with old milk jugs, if necessary. Freezing can halt growth and/or form buttons.
3. ###### In summer, shade plants from the hot sun, if necessary. Water consistently during germination and growth. Add mulch to conserve moisture.
