#### How to plant

1. ###### Create raised mounds 15 to 20 cm tall and about 30 cm wide. Plan 90 cm between mounds so that there is enough space for vines to run.
2. ###### Plant the slips on a warm, overcast day, when the soil temperature has reached 60°F (15°C). Break off the lower leaves, leaving only the top ones.
3. ###### Set the slips deep enough to cover the roots and the stem up to the leaves. Sweet potatoes will form on the nodes.
4. ###### Water with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer, then water generously for 7 to 10 days to make sure that the plants root well.
